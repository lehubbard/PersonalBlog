My name is Lucas Hubbard. I live in south-central Michigan with my wife: Hannah. Together, we are working to create a handmade life that integrates us into our local ecology. We believe that, by recognizing our interdependence with the other plants and animals around us, we can begin to build free, resilient, and meaningful lives. Iâ€™m interested in regenerative agriculture, beekeeping, woodworking, anarchism, backpacking, small-scale societies, folk culture, wild edibles, craft, photography, natural health, punk rock, and an escape from the status quo.

We live in a time of accelerating crisis. I believe that the best (and only) way we can face the coming uncertainty is as small-scale producers. As farmers and crafts people servicing a hyper local community, I believe we can rediscover meaningful work, health, and fulfilling social relations. As small-scale producers, we can build autonomy while addressing ecological insanity and social inequities. We can value skills and relationships over jobs and careers. We can be a part of nature instead of something apart from it. We can once again feel our hearts beat and our muscles burn.
