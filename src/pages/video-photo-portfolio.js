                        I have worked professionally shooting weddings and real estate video. 
                        I have also worked on music videos, narrative films, and short form documentaries. 
                        I believe I have developed a unique style utilizing handheld closeups and natural light. Looking forward, 
                        I would like to shoot more music videos and experiment with my style. I am available for hire as a 
                        director/ cinematographer and as an editor.</h3>
